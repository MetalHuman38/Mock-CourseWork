# Mock-CourseWork

Mocked Coursework Project Setup

This repository serves as a mock setup for our coursework project. It includes basic configurations and files to help us get started with the development process. Below is a brief overview of the project structure and the purpose of each file and directory:

Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

CrudAPI.v1/ root directory

app/: This directory contains the main application files.
db.js: This file contains the configuration for connecting to the database.
docker-compose.yaml: This file defines services, networks, and volumes for Docker containers.
Dockerfile: This file contains instructions to build a Docker image for our application.
node_modules/: This directory contains all the dependencies installed via npm.
package.json: This file contains metadata and dependencies information for our Node.js project.
package-lock.json: This file is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree or package.json.


README.md: This file provides an overview of the project setup and structure.
Within the app/ directory, you'll find the following subdirectories:

app.js: This file serves as the entry point for our application.
backend/: This directory contains backend-related files and components.
frontend/: This directory contains frontend-related files and components.
middleware/: This directory contains middleware functions used in our application.
routes/: This directory contains route handlers for different API endpoints.
tests/: This directory contains test files for our application.

Getting Started
To get started with the development of our project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the CrudAPI.v1 directory.
